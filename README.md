This is a fine art website for my personal artwork, where page 1 displays information about my conceptual thinking behind the artowrk as well as a short artist bio. Page 2 displays images of recent paintings that can be viewed by scrolling left to right. Page 3 is a contact form if someone viewing the page has questions about an artwork such as availability.
The technologies used to create this website are html and css for styling. 
Future improvements:
1. I would edit the text boxes on the first page and the background to continue to explore different display options.
2. I would continue to add images to the recent works page as well as an otpion to be able to view information about each of the works displayed.
3. I would add funtionality to the contact form to submit the information to a form sheet.
