           <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
           <p>
            In my paintings I choose to depict scenes of the natural world that convey a story about themes such as isolation and resilience; whether it is a tree standing apart from the others or a path through a forest. I am influenced by the great master painters, especially the landscape painters of the Romantic period. Like painters, and writers, of that time I seek to gain a better understanding of nature through experience. The best way to learn about nature is to go out into it and paint directly from it. I look for the compositions that are already around us and convey an idea of the beauty and elusiveness of the natural world. By painting on site outdoors, or en plein air, I seek to understand the ever-changing relationship that we have with the natural world and how we can better live in harmony with it.

            After I create these outdoor studies, I look for a deeper understanding of the landscape through studio paintings, which are often larger and more fully rendered. After careful research into techniques of Romantic painters, especially the Hudson River School painters, I employ a traditional approach to painting involving sketches, an underpainting, and layering of paint to create a depth of color to my paintings.

            Through drawing attention to scenes in the wilderness that evoke emotion and create a narrative, I hope to get across the idea that there is still so much of the world that is left unexplored. In my paintings I strive to include many of the details that I observe while out in nature without creating a painting that is overwhelming to view. I search for a balance between crisp clarity and softness of paint that is accurate to the scene, but gives the sensation that we experience when immersed in nature. By drawing attention to these scenes I seek to stress the importance of conservation efforts and preserving these natural lands. As we immerse ourselves in the wilderness, we can  develop a relationship with nature beyond the conquest of it that permeates the relation of civilization with the untamed world.
